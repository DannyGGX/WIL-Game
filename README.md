# Spin Doctor Multiplayer Unity Game

## Background
This game is made for the Work Integrated Learning (WIL) module for 3rd year of the Vega BCIS Game Design and Development degree in Johannessburg, South Africa.

## About
In this game, players get to play as spin doctors covering up for politician blunders. It is a party game similar to Cards Against Humanity or Jack Box Quiplash.
This version is for PC. 
We will try to implement multiplayer for multiple devices. But if we have difficulties with that, this game will just have pass-and-play style multiplayer.
